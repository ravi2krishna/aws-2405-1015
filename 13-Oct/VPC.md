- A virtual private cloud is an on-demand configurable pool of shared resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation between the different organizations using the resources.

#### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) 
- VPC is a service that lets customers provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources(Servers, Database, Applications etc ) in a VIRTUAL NETWORK that you define.
- Having VPC is similar to having your own data center inside AWS.
- VPC is the Backbone of infrastructure  for any systems that we decide to build on AWS.
