## Fault Tolerance & Auto Scaling

- Fault tolerance is the resilient property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of failure or major dysfunction in one or more of its components.
- What Auto Scaling does is, it analyzes the load coming in and deploys the new servers to meet that demand, say around 300 people are coming in then, it will spin up new servers and set the application for us automatically.
- Now we need to have the exact configuration of server 1 to be replicated across server 2 and server 3 as well.
