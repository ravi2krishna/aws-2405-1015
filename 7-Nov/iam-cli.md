## IAM - Identity & Access Management

- IAM manages **Authentication & Authorization**
- With IAM you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS
- The user created when you first create your AWS account is called the **root** user.
- By default, the root user has FULL administrative rights
- IAM User : A User within an account that performs daily tasks. An IAM user is an identity with long-term credentials that is used to interact with AWS in an account.
- IAM Group : An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage.
- IAM Policy : IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method(IAM User, IAM Group & IAM Role) that you use to perform the operation.

## AWS CLI - Command Line Interface

- The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified **tool** to manage your AWS services.
- With AWS CLI you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
