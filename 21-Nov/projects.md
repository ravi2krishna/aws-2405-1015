## AWS Projects 

### Project 1 : Design Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Learning Management System (LMS) 

- This project focuses on creating a well-structured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for hosting a Learning Management System (LMS) on a cloud platform. The VPC will provide the networking foundation required to ensure the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the LMS. The project encompasses the creation of VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and security groups to establish a robust infrastructure for the LMS.

### Project 2 : Deploying Servers - Learning Management System (LMS)

- This project focuses on provisioning and configuring servers to host the Learning Management System (LMS) within the previously designed Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The servers will include instances for the backend, frontend, and database, each operating within dedicated subnets and under the security provisions of the VPC. By successfully completing this project, the LMS infrastructure will be established and ready for deployment.
